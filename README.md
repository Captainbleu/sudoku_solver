# Sudoku Solver

This project provides a simple Sudoku solver implemented in Python. The code is organised in a clean object-oriented architecture.

```
sudoku/
├── model/       # Board and Cell classes
├── solver/      # Solving strategies and backtracking
└── util/        # I/O helpers and printer
```

Run the demo with:

```bash
python main.py
```
